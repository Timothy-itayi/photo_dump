# ಥ‿ಥ Photo Drop Web Application

A simple web application that allows users to upload images directly to an AWS S3 bucket using pre-signed URLs, generated by an AWS Lambda function.




## 🚀 Project Purpose

This project was built to demonstrate how to upload files directly to **AWS S3** using pre-signed URLs, and it serves as a portfolio piece to showcase AWS serverless services.

- 🧠 **AWS Lambda** – Serverless backend function (Node.js) to generate pre-signed URLs
- 🔗 **API Gateway** – RESTful API for generating the pre-signed URLs
- 📦 **S3** – Object storage to store uploaded images
- 🌐 **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Simple frontend for uploading images

The app provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading files directly to your AWS S3 bucket.
